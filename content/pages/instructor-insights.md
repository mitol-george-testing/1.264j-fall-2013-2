Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _1.264J Database, Internet, and Systems Integration Technologies_ as it was taught by Dr. George Kocur in Fall 2013.

The course focuses on defining an engineering and business software system, producing a working version quickly, managing the overall process, and becoming very familiar with database and Web technologies that are central to current software systems. The course has no programming, except that students write database queries in SQL; the system is built using a set of tools that do not require software coding.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

The goal is for students to learn to design, implement and manage engineering and business software systems. It’s an engineering course, and students build a system during the term. As part of the course, students learn about project management, software modeling (UML), databases, the Internet and Web, security, and data communications.

![67 students took this course in Fall 2013.](BASEURL_PLACEHOLDER/resources/1-264_stat-students)

### Enrollment

The enrollment in this course in Fall 2013 was 67. The average enrollment is 54.

### Breakdown by Year

The students are first-year master’s degree students in non-computer science majors.

### Breakdown by Major

Most students are in master’s programs for transportation engineering or logistics/supply chain, but there are also students from several other engineering backgrounds.

### Typical Student Background

About half of the students have a few years of work experience, and about half of the students come directly from an undergraduate program. They typically have limited experience with software and systems.
